@article{Bauer16,
	Abstract = {Abstract The considerable interest in the high performance computing (HPC) community regarding analyzing and visualization data without first writing to disk, i. e., in situ processing, is due to several factors. First is an I/O cost savings, where data is analyzed/visualized while being generated, without first storing to a filesystem. Second is the potential for increased accuracy, where fine temporal sampling of transient analysis might expose some complex behavior missed in coarse temporal sampling. Third is the ability to use all available resources, CPU's and accelerators, in the computation of analysis products. This STAR paper brings together researchers, developers and practitioners using in situ methods in extreme-scale HPC with the goal to present existing methods, infrastructures, and a range of computational science and engineering applications using in situ analysis and visualization.},

@article{Asch18,
	Abstract = { Over the past four years, the Big Data and Exascale Computing (BDEC) project organized a series of five international workshops that aimed to explore the ways in which the new forms of data-centric discovery introduced by the ongoing revolution in high-end data analysis (HDA) might be integrated with the established, simulation-centric paradigm of the high-performance computing (HPC) community. Based on those meetings, we argue that the rapid proliferation of digital data generators, the unprecedented growth in the volume and diversity of the data they generate, and the intense evolution of the methods for analyzing and using that data are radically reshaping the landscape of scientific computing. The most critical problems involve the logistics of wide-area, multistage workflows that will move back and forth across the computing continuum, between the multitude of distributed sensors, instruments and other devices at the networks edge, and the centralized resources of commercial clouds and HPC centers. We suggest that the prospects for the future integration of technological infrastructures and research ecosystems need to be considered at three different levels. First, we discuss the convergence of research applications and workflows that establish a research paradigm that combines both HPC and HDA, where ongoing progress is already motivating efforts at the other two levels. Second, we offer an account of some of the problems involved with creating a converged infrastructure for peripheral environments, that is, a shared infrastructure that can be deployed throughout the network in a scalable manner to meet the highly diverse requirements for processing, communication, and buffering/storage of massive data workflows of many different scientific domains. Third, we focus on some opportunities for software ecosystem convergence in big, logically centralized facilities that execute large-scale simulations and models and/or perform large-scale data analytics. We close by offering some conclusions and recommendations for future investment and policy review. },

	Abstract = {{\it Xi-cam} is an extensible platform for data management, analysis and visualization. {\it Xi-cam} aims to provide a flexible and extensible approach to synchrotron data treatment as a solution to rising demands for high-volume/high-throughput processing pipelines. The core of {\it Xi-cam} is an extensible plugin-based graphical user interface platform which provides users with an interactive interface to processing algorithms. Plugins are available for SAXS/WAXS/GISAXS/GIWAXS, tomography and NEXAFS data. With {\it Xi-cam}'s `advanced' mode, data processing steps are designed as a graph-based workflow, which can be executed live, locally or remotely. Remote execution utilizes high-performance computing or de-localized resources, allowing for the effective reduction of high-throughput data. {\it Xi-cam}'s plugin-based architecture targets cross-facility and cross-technique collaborative development, in support of multi-modal analysis. {\it Xi-cam} is open-source and cross-platform, and available for download on GitHub.},

	Abstract = {With petascale applications comes petascale data; gleaning knowledge and insight from this large-scale data is widely accepted to be a limiting factor in many fields of scientific endeavor. Large-scale data presents two incredible challenges: scale and complexity. The scale challenge refers to the problem of being able to process tremendous numbers of bytes of data within some time constraint. The complexity challenge is more subtle; petascale data is inherently complex and reducing this data to comprehensible forms is difficult. For the scale challenge, it is often assumed that continued usage of techniques viable at the terascale will provide a recipe for success at the petascale. We argue the opposite: following this path will result in cost prohibitive solutions. Instead, we must pursue 'smarter' techniques, such as in situ and multi-resolution processing, which are well established by a decade's worth of research. The forms of postprocessing are very diverse, but they can be summarized in broad use cases: data exploration, presentation graphics, quantitative analysis, comparative analysis, and visual debugging. Together, these use cases are responsive to the complexity challenge. Moreover, these use cases are responsive to the demands of the user community. Making pretty pictures is just one component of the simulation community's postprocessing needs and all of these needs must be addressed for petascale data. A major focus of this paper is to construct a road map for realizing this broad set of use cases at the petascale, and, further, to do this in the most economical way possible. None of the smart processing techniques we consider are a panacea; none are capable of supporting every use case. However, a software architecture that underpins these processing techniques and that can dynamically select between them will provide an economical way to meet these challenging requirements, and in this paper we discuss such an architecture.},

	Abstractnote = {Decaf is a dataflow system for the parallel communication of coupled tasks in an HPC workflow. The dataflow can perform arbitrary data transformations ranging from simply forwarding data to complex data redistribution. Decaf does this by allowing the user to allocate resources and execute custom code in the dataflow. All communication through the dataflow is efficient parallel message passing over MPI. The runtime for calling tasks is entirely message-driven; Decaf executes a task when all messages for the task have been received. Such a messagedriven runtime allows cyclic task dependencies in the workflow graph, for example, to enact computational steering based on the result of downstream tasks. Decaf includes a simple Python API for describing the workflow graph. This allows Decaf to stand alone as a complete workflow system, but Decaf can also be used as the dataflow layer by one or more other workflow systems to form a heterogeneous task-based computing environment. In one experiment, we couple a molecular dynamics code with a visualization tool using the FlowVR and Damaris workflow systems and Decaf for the dataflow. In another experiment, we test the coupling of a cosmology code with Voronoi tessellation and density estimation codes using MPI for the simulation, the DIY programming model for the two analysis codes, and Decaf for the dataflow. Such workflows consisting of heterogeneous software infrastructures exist because components are developed separately with different programming models and runtimes, and this is the first time that such heterogeneous coupling of diverse components was demonstrated in situ on HPC systems.},

	Abstract = {e-Science focuses on the use of computational tools and resources to analyze large scientific datasets. Performing these analyses often requires running a variety of computational tools specific to a given scientific domain. This places a significant burden on individual researchers for whom simply running these tools may be prohibitively difficult, let alone combining tools into a complete analysis, or acquiring data and appropriate computational resources. This limits the productivity of individual researchers and represents a significant barrier to potential scientific discovery. In order to alleviate researchers from such unnecessary complexities and promote more robust science, we have developed a tool integration framework called Galaxy; Galaxy abstracts individual tools behind a consistent and easy-to-use web interface to enable advanced data analysis that requires no informatics expertise. Furthermore, Galaxy facilitates easy addition of developed tools, thus supporting tool developers, as well as transparent and reproducible communication of computationally intensive analyses. Recently, we have enabled trivial deployment of complete a Galaxy solution on aggregated infrastructures, including cloud computing providers.},

	Abstract = {Summary This paper introduces FireWorks, a workflow software for running high-throughput calculation workflows at supercomputing centers. FireWorks has been used to complete over 50 million CPU-hours worth of computational chemistry and materials science calculations at the National Energy Research Supercomputing Center. It has been designed to serve the demanding high-throughput computing needs of these applications, with extensive support for (i) concurrent execution through job packing, (ii) failure detection and correction, (iii) provenance and reporting for long-running projects, (iv) automated duplicate detection, and (v) dynamic workflows (i.e., modifying the workflow graph during runtime). We have found that these features are highly relevant to enabling modern data-driven and high-throughput science applications, and we discuss our implementation strategy that rests on Python and NoSQL databases (MongoDB). Finally, we present performance data and limitations of our approach along with planned future work. Copyright {\copyright} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
