The complexities of in situ processing can be daunting initially for both users and developers. In this presentation we demonstrate that much of the complexity of using ParaView for computational monitoring can be hidden from the user such that the user experience is very similar to using ParaView in a post hoc fashion. This is done by using the tools for remote connections that many scientists that work on HPC-sized problems will likely be familiar with. This remote connection mechanism available through the ParaView GUI launches both the ParaView Catalyst linked simulation and ParaViewâ€™s pvserver executable and lets them know how to communicate with each other. Additionally, the tools automatically connect the ParaView GUI to pvserver for a fully connected in situ system.
