Slycat is a web-based system for analysis of large, high-dimensional data such as that produced by High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms. The Slycat server integrates data ingestion, scalable analysis, data management, and visualization with commodity web clients using a multi-tiered hierarchy of data and model storage. In this talk we discuss a project, VideoSwarm in which images created in situ during an ensemble run of simulations was used to identify common and diverging parameters being studied.
