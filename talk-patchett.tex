Simulation scientist time should be considered when designing simulation runs. The decision to produce artifacts, in particular what kind of artifacts, representing the simulation has implications on the time a scientist must spend to understand the simulation state. This talk relates observations of four techniques used by a simulation scientist during a set of simulations runs to study asteroid generated tsunami: lossless compression, resampling to image data, feature extraction using simple threshold operation, and maintaining a small amount of provenance as metadata. All of these have the potential of saving the scientist time while doing analysis at the expense of a small amount of computational time.
